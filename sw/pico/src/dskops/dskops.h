/**
 * Disk Operations.
 *
 * This provides a higher-level interface to the SD Card and FATFS libraries (3rd-Party).
 *
 * Since the SD Card and FATFS are 3rd-Party libraries, this modules centralizes the
 * use of them so that they can be more easily replaced if so desired (a problem is
 * found with them or a 'better' library is found).
 *
 * This module provides a shared file path name buffer (char*) to get file name/path results
 * into. The shared buffer is returned the a call to the `dsk_get_shared_path_buf()`.
 * This is to save on memory use and avoid repeated malloc/free calls. However, that
 * means that the result returned by a function might change if another disk/file operation
 * is performed. If the caller intends to keep the result for an extended period (possibly
 * across disk/file method calls) a different buffer should be used.
