 * HWRT uses the Fifo for base (core (ha!)) level communication between
 * the cores for the supervisor/system functionality. The Pico SDK warns about
 * using the Fifo, as it is used by the Pico runtime to support multicore operation.
 *
 * HWRT acknowledges the warnings, and will take care to assure that the Fifo and
 * the HWRT code_seq is in an appropriate state when operations are performed that will
 * cause the Pico SDK/runtime to use them.
 *
 * For general purpose application communication between the functionality running on
 * the two cores queues will be used.
